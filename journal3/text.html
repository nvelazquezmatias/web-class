    <p>As a web design and coding beginner, I feel satisfied with my work. It is no secret that coding is intimidating and requires much hard work. However, this class taught me something completely new. As I continue to practice, I am confident that I can advance.</p>

    While I do not intend to pursue a computing career, I recognize the value of this skill set. As a creative person, I only considered a website's aesthetics from a user perspective. Nevertheless, this class taught me the importance of focusing on a website's functionality. I have learned that functionality and aesthetics go hand in hand and are both crucial to a successful website.
