        <p>The web is a network of individual computers connected. Initially, people used websites primarily to connect digital and print materials. Since humans code websites by hand rather than machines, they have a handmade feel. Only half of the world has access to the internet; it is up to us to fix this. We need to use the internet to cater to our needs rather than rely on commercialized platforms to connect us. By creating personal websites, we can create meaningful internet use.</p>
