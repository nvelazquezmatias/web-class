    <p>European furniture design is art that balances functionality, utility, visual appeal, and innovation. Its influence can be felt globally in both residential and commercial spaces.</p>
    <p>When designing furniture, designers prioritize the comfort and practicality of the user without sacrificing aesthetic design. They use materials such as plastic, plywood, and metal to create timeless pieces that are both creative and functional.</p>
    <p>Several talented modern designers in Europe have significantly impacted the field of design. These include Michel Boyer, Le Corbusier, Pierre Jeanneret, Charlotte Perriand, and Piero Lissoni. </p>
